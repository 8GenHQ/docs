## What is Lumen?

Lumen is one of 8Gen's content creation engines, it allows you to create high quality text stories with ease .

## The  <code>/gen-ts</code>  command

To access Lumen you need to use the <code>/gen-ts</code> command in our discord server.

### Command arguments
<ParamField path="script" type="file">
  A script file for Lumen
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="music" type="file">
  A music (.mp3) file that will be used in the video
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="p1_voice" type="string">
  The voice name for P1
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="p2_voice" type="string">
  The voice name for P2
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="contact_name" type="string">
  The contact name for the video
</ParamField>

<Warning>
  Even though the background argument is optional inside of discord, a background is still required. (max backgound file size is **2 GB**)
</Warning>

<ParamField path="background" type="file">
  A background (.mp4) file that will be used in the video
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="background_link" type="string">
  A direct link to the background file, cannot be a youtube/instagram/tiktok link, use a service like [Litterbox](https://litterbox.catbox.moe/) to get a direct link
</ParamField>

## The script

Lumen requires a script file for the video so that the engine knows what to generate. It is a crucial part of making videos with Lumen.

A script file is just an ordinary text file that is just formatted in a special syntax, it can be created with software like notepad.

<Tip>
  We recommend to not use generative AI like ChatGPT for script generation. Scripts generated by the AI are very low quality and the videos may not perform well on social media platforms.
</Tip>

### Script syntax

The script needs to be formatted in a certain way so that Lumen understands what to generate.

#### P1 and P2
Let's start with something simple: making the characters in the script talk. As of now it is only possible to have two characters (P1 and P2).

To make a character to say something just put <code>P1:</code> or <code>P2:</code>.

Here's an example:
<CodeGroup>
```plaintext Example1.txt
P1: This will appear on the right
P2: This will appear on the left
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  When writing the script avoid using punctuation which are dots, commas, etc this can make the video more natural. (but dont be dumb and keep the question and exclamation marks)
</Tip>

#### Linebreaks (text folding)
